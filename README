The INTERTWinE project is committed to helping application developers to write
scalable code that can run on the world's largest supercomputers, by employing
combinations of existing programming models (so called hybridisation) in a way
that future-proofs the development work for the next generation of HPC systems.

This resource pack is to help developers interoperate GASPI with MPI to allow
effective and efficient asynchronous one-sided communication in key kernels
(incremental porting of applications), which cannot be achieved with MPI
one-sided routines. There are two aspects to interoperability: memory management
and communication management.

Other programming model/ API combinations are addressed in other resource packs
available from the INTERTWinE Developer Hub
(http://www.intertwine-project.eu/developer-hub).
